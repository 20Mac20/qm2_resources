Hi - I'm Joy, a second-year BASc student majoring in Sciences and Engineering and with a minor in Cultures.

# Macrina
Hiya I'm Macrina, a societies major with minor in Health and Environment. 
My 'big love' is Politics, but this year I'm branching out BASc-style and taking a more quantitative route- with data science and neuroscience- that I'm hoping to apply in my understanding of political systems, campaigns, and ideologies.
